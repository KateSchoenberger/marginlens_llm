Katelyn Schoenberger is a former VP/Quantitative Analyst in Risk Services at Bank of America. Frequently overwhelmed with the influx of requests related to SIMM from traders, Kate noticed that the harmony between front-office and middle-office functions was asynchronous, meaning traders are under extreme pressure to receive the insights on their data in a quick fashion; contrary to the front-office speed, quants in middle-office facing roles are not usually operating under the same pace or mentality.
Instead, Simma allows for traders and other front-office professionals who are non-technical to input their own questions without having to wait for answers to their questions from the busy risk quants. 
As a quant, Kate noticed that her fellow teammates, while highly intelligent, were generating very generic insights on the reports without going into greater analysis on the financial implications or math behind the SIMM calculations, which is very quantitatively involved, time-consuming, and manually processed behind the scenes through the UI system. The reports were also very bulky and lengthy – something many traders don’t have time to skim and account for in great length. Even incorporating pivot tables, charts, and other visual aids was excessive. Traders just want quick answers, so now, with Simma, they can directly ask whatever question they desire on their own time.
